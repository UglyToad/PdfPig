Different approved documents give guidance on each of the technical parts of the regulations. These are all listed in the back of the approved documents. In addition to guidance, some approved documents include provisions that must be followed exactly, as required by regulations or where methods of test or calculation are approved by the Secretary of State. Each approved document covers the requirements of the Building Regulations 2010 relating to a different aspect of building work. Building work must also comply with all other applicable requirements of the Building Regulations 2010 and all other applicable legislation.How is construction regulated in England?Most building work being carried out in England must comply with the Building Regulations 2010. The Building Regulations are made under powers in the Building Act 1984. Building Regulations protect the health and safety of people in and around buildings, they also provide for energy and water conservation and access to and use of buildings.The Manual to the Building Regulations (references to this in the introduction are taken from the first edition) gives an overview of the building regulatory system in England. You can access the most recent version of the manual at: www.gov.uk/guidance/building-regulations-and-approved-documents-index. How do you comply with the Building Regulations?Building work must meet all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations. To comply with the Building Regulations, it is necessary both to follow the correct procedures and meet technical performance requirements. The approved documents set out what, in ordinary circumstances, may be accepted as one way to comply with the Building Regulations. Note, however, that:• Complying with the guidance in the approved documents does not guarantee that building work complies with the requirements of the regulations – the approved documents cannot cover all circumstances. Those responsible for building work must consider whether following the guidance in the approved documents is likely to meet the requirements in the particular circumstances of their case. • There may be other ways to comply with the requirements than those described in an approved document. If those responsible for meeting the requirements prefer to meet a requirement in some other way than described in an approved document, they should seek to agree this with the relevant building control body at an early stage. ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONii Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010Those responsible for building work include agents, designers, builders, installers and the building owner. For further information, see Chapter 7 in Volume 1 and paragraphs A26, B2 and F2 in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations.  The Building Regulations can be contravened by not following the correct procedures or not meeting the technical performance requirements. If the building owner or those responsible for the works contravene the Building Regulations, the local authority may prosecute them in the magistrates’ court. For further information on enforcement and sanctions in the existing system, see Chapter B in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations. What do the Building Regulations cover?‘Building work’ is a legal term for work covered by the Building Regulations. Where a building is not exempt, the Building Regulations apply to all types of building work as defined in regulation 3 of the Building Regulations. For further information, what constitutes building work is covered in Chapter A, Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations. The Building Regulations contain sections dealing with definitions, procedures and the expected technical performance of building work. For example, the Building Regulations:a. define what types of building, plumbing and heating work are classed as building work in regulation 3 (for further information see paragraphs A14 to A16 in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations).b. specify types of building that are exempt from the Building Regulations (for further information see Table A1 and paragraph A11 in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations).c. set out the notification procedures to follow when undertaking building work (for further information see Figure 2.1 in Volume 1 of the Manual to the Building Regulations). d. set out the technical requirements (see Table 7.1 in Volume 1 of the Manual to the Building Regulations) with which the individual aspects of building design and construction must comply in the interests of the health and safety of building users, of energy efficiency (for further information see paragraphs A12(d)–(f), A14(f)–(h), A22, A23, B2(c) and F24 in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations), and of access to and use of buildings.e. set out the standards for building materials and workmanship in carrying out building work (for further information see Chapter 7 in Volume 1, and paragraphs F8 to F11 in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations).When must a building control body be notified?It is often necessary to notify a building control body of planned building work. To help ensure that work complies with the Building Regulations, those responsible for building work may need to use one of the two types of building control body listed below:a. a local authority building control body (for further information see Chapter B in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations)b. an approved inspector (for further information see Chapter E in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations). ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition iiiIf building work consists only of installing certain types of services or fittings (e.g. fuel-burning appliances or replacement windows) and the building owner employs an installer that is registered with a relevant competent person scheme designated in the regulations, a building control body does not need to be notified. Third party schemes of certification and accreditation of installers can provide confidence that the required level of performance for a system, product, component or structure can be achieved. Building control bodies may accept certification under such schemes as evidence of compliance with a relevant standard. However, a building control body should establish before the start of the building work that a scheme is adequate for the purposes of the Building Regulations.For further information about third party certification schemes and competent person schemes, see Chapter 5 in Volume 1 and Chapter C in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations.How to use this approved document Each approved document contains:• general guidance on the performance expected of materials and building work in order to comply with each of the requirements of the Building Regulations, and • practical examples and solutions on how to achieve compliance for some of the more common building situations. They may not provide appropriate guidance if the case is unusual in terms of its design, setting, use, scale or technology. Non-standard conditions may include any of the following: • difficult ground conditions • buildings with unusual occupancies or high levels of complexity • very large or very tall buildings • large timber buildings • some buildings that incorporate modern construction methods. Anyone using the approved documents should have sufficient knowledge and skills to understand the guidance and correctly apply it to the building work. This is important because simply following the guidance does not guarantee that your building work will comply with the legal requirements of the Building Regulations. Each approved document contains legal requirements (which you must follow) and guidance (which you may or may not choose to follow). The text in a box with a green background at the beginning of each section of an approved document is taken from the Building Regulations. This text sets out the legal requirements. The explanation which follows the legal requirements is guidance (see Diagram i below). The guidance then explains one or more ways to demonstrate how building work can be shown to comply with the legal requirements in common circumstances. The terms in green lettering in an approved document are key terms, listed and explained in the appendix to that approved document. Guidance in the approved documents addresses most, but not all, situations that building owners will face. Situations may arise that are not covered. You or your advisers will need to carefully consider whether following the guidance will mean that the requirements of the Building Regulations will be met.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONiv Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B2Requirement B2: Internal fire spread (linings)This section deals with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.RequirementRequirementLimits on applicationInternal ﬁre spread (linings)B2. (1)  To inhibit the spread of fire within the building, the internal linings shall—    (a)  adequately resist the spread of flame over their surfaces; and    (b)  have, if ignited, either a rate of heat release or a rate of fire growth, which is reasonable in the circumstances. (2)  In this paragraph “internal linings” means the materials or products used in lining any partition, wall, ceiling or other internal structure.IntentionIn the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B2 is met by achieving a restricted spread of flame over internal linings. The building fabric should make a limited contribution to fire growth, including a low rate of heat release.It is particularly important in circulation spaces, where linings may offer the main means by which fire spreads and where rapid spread is most likely to prevent occupants from escaping.Requirement B2 does not include guidance on the following.a. Generation of smoke and fumes.b. The upper surfaces of floors and stairs.c. Furniture and fittings.➊➋Key➊ The law: extract from the Building Regulations 2010.➋ Statutory guidance.Diagram i  The relationship between regulations and guidance in the approved documentsFor further information about the use of technical guidance, see Chapter 7 in Volume 1 and Chapter F in Volume 2 of the Manual to the Building Regulations.Where to get further helpIf you are unsure whether you have the knowledge and skills to apply the guidance correctly, or if you do not understand the technical guidance or other information in this approved document or the additional detailed technical references to which it directs you, you should seek further help.

Volume 1 deals solely with dwellings, including blocks of flats, while Volume 2 deals with all other types of building covered by the Building Regulations.Arrangement of sections0.2 Requirements B1–B5 of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are dealt with separately in one or more sections. Each requirement is shown at the start of the relevant sections. 0.3 The provisions in this document have the following aims:Requirement B1: When there is a fire, ensure both:a. satisfactory means of sounding an alarmb. satisfactory means of escape for people.Requirement B2: Inhibit the spread of fire over internal linings of buildings.Requirement B3: The building must be built such that all of the following are achieved in the event of a fire:a. the premature collapse of the building is avoidedb. sufficient fire separation is provided within buildings and between adjoining buildingsc. automatic fire suppression is provided where necessaryd. the unseen spread of fire and smoke in cavities is restricted. Requirement B4: Restrict both:a. the potential for fire to spread over external walls and roofs (including compliance with regulations 6(4) and 7(2))b. the spread of fire from one building to another.Requirement B5: Ensure both:a. satisfactory access for the fire service and its appliancesb. facilities in buildings to help firefighters save the lives of people in and around buildings.Regulation 38: Provide fire safety information to building owners.0.4 Guidance is given on each aspect separately, though many are closely interlinked. The document should be considered as a whole. The relationship between different requirements and their interdependency should be recognised. Particular attention should be given to the situation where one part of the guidance is not fully followed as this could have a negative effect on other provisions.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION2 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010Appendices: Information common to more than one requirement of Part B0.5 Guidance on matters that refer to more than one section of this document can be found in the following appendices.Appendix A: Key termsAppendix B: Performance of materials, products and structuresAppendix C: Fire doorsetsAppendix D: Methods of measurementAppendix E: SprinklersAppendix F: Standards referred toAppendix G: Documents referred toManagement of premises0.6 The Building Regulations do not impose any requirements on the management of a building, but do assume that it will be properly managed. This includes, for example, keeping protected escape routes virtually ‘fire sterile’.Appropriate fire safety design considers the way in which a building will be managed. Any reliance on an unrealistic or unsustainable management regime cannot be considered to have met the requirements of the regulations.Once the building is in use, the management regime should be maintained and a suitable risk assessment undertaken for any variation in that regime. Failure to take proper management responsibility may result in the prosecution of an employer, building owner or occupier under legislation such as the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.Property protection0.7 The Building Regulations are intended to ensure a reasonable standard of life safety in a fire. The protection of property, including the building itself, often requires additional measures. Insurers usually set higher standards before accepting the insurance risk.Many insurers use the RISCAuthority Design Guide for the Fire Protection of Buildings by the Fire Protection Association (FPA) as a basis for providing guidance to the building designer on what  they require.Further information on the protection of property can be obtained from the FPA website:  www.thefpa.co.uk.Inclusive design0.8 The fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations aim to achieve reasonable standards of health and safety for people in and around buildings. People, regardless of ability, age or gender, should be able to access buildings and use their facilities. The fire safety measures incorporated into a building should take account of the needs of everyone who may access the building, both as visitors and as people who live or work in it. It is not appropriate, except in exceptional circumstances, to assume that certain groups of people will be excluded from a building because of its use.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 3The provisions in this approved document are considered to be of a reasonable standard for most buildings. However, some people’s specific needs might not be addressed. In some situations, additional measures may be needed to accommodate these needs. This should be done on a case-by-case basis.Alternative approaches0.9 The fire safety requirements of the Building Regulations will probably be satisfied by following the relevant guidance in this approved document. However, approved documents provide guidance for some common building situations and there may be alternative methods of complying with the Building Regulations’ requirements.If alternative methods are adopted, the overall level of safety should not be lower than the approved document provides. It is the responsibility of those undertaking the work to demonstrate compliance. If other standards or guidance documents are adopted, the relevant fire safety recommendations in those publications should be followed in their entirety. However, in some circumstances it may be necessary to use one publication to supplement another. Care must be taken when using supplementary guidance to ensure that an integrated approach is used in any one building.Guidance documents intended specifically for assessing fire safety in existing buildings often include less onerous provisions than those for new buildings and are therefore unlikely to be appropriate for building work that is controlled by the Building Regulations.Buildings for industrial and commercial activities that present a special fire hazard, e.g. those that sell fuels, may require additional fire precautions to those in this approved document.Health care premises0.10 Health care premises and the patients who use them are diverse. Patients using the premises require different types of care to suit their specific needs. The choice of fire safety strategy depends on both of the following.a. How a building is designed, furnished, staffed and managed.b. The needs of the patients.The Department of Health (DoH) guidance documents on fire precautions in health care buildings, Firecode, take account of the particular characteristics of these buildings and should be followed. Firecode contains managerial and other fire safety provisions that are outside the scope of the Building Regulations.Unsupervised group homes0.11 An unsupervised group home for not more than six mental health service users should be regarded as having a purpose group of either of the following.a. An existing house of one or two storeys for which the means of escape are provided in accordance with DoH HTM 88 should be regarded as a purpose group 1(c) building.b. A new building may be more appropriately regarded as being in purpose group 2(b).Shopping complexes0.12 Although the guidance in this document may be readily applied to individual shops, shopping complexes present different escape problems. The design of units within a shopping complex should be compatible with the fire strategy for the complex as a whole. A suitable approach is given in Annex E of BS 9999.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION4 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010Assembly buildings0.13 Assembly buildings where a large number of people are present require additional considerations for means of escape; for example, fixed seating may limit the ability of people to escape.Guidance on fixed seating and other aspects of means of escape in assembly buildings is given in Annex D of BS 9999. For buildings to which the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 applies, the Sports Grounds Safety Authority’s Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds should also be followed.Schools0.14 The design of fire safety in schools is covered by Building Bulletin 100, which should be used. Building Bulletin 100 contains fire safety provisions that are outside the scope of the Building Regulations.Prisons provided under section 33 of the Prisons Act 19520.15 Prisons are exempted from the functional requirements of Parts B1 to B5 of the Building Regulations under section 33 of the Prisons Act 1952. It is usual that prisons should comply with the fire safety requirements of the Building Regulations, except where the requirements are incompatible with safe custody, good order or security. HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) provides guidance documents on fire precautions in prisons, which take account of the public safety need to secure doors and exits while maintaining life safety objectives. The HMPPS Custodial Premises Fire Safety Design Guide (FSDG) is the design standard for fire safety in prisons, providing structured guidance for those involved in the planning, designing or approval of new or altered buildings. Further guidance documents on fire safety in prisons are provided by HMPPS. These documents may also be used for other places of lawful detention. Buildings containing one or more atria0.16 A building with an atrium that passes through compartment floors may need special fire safety measures. Guidance is given in Annexes B and C of BS 9999. Buildings of special architectural or historic interest0.17 Where Part B applies to existing buildings, particularly buildings of special architectural or historic interest for which the guidance in this document might prove too restrictive, some variation of the provisions in this document may be appropriate. In such cases, it is appropriate to assess the hazard and risk in the particular case and consider a range of fire safety features in that context.Fire safety engineering0.18 Fire safety engineering might provide an alternative approach to fire safety. Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a satisfactory standard of fire safety in some complex buildings and in buildings that contain different uses.Fire safety engineering may also be suitable for solving a specific problem with a design that otherwise follows the provisions in this document.0.19 BS 7974 and supporting published documents (PDs) provide a framework for and guidance on the application of fire safety engineering principles to the design of buildings.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 5Purpose groups0.20 Building uses are classified within different purpose groups, which represent different levels of hazard (see Table 0.1). A purpose group can apply to a whole building or to a compartment within the building, and should relate to the main use of the building or compartment.0.21 Where a building or compartment has more than one use, it is appropriate to assign each different use to its own purpose group in the following situations.a. If the ancillary use is a flat.b. If both of the following apply.i. The building or compartment has an area of more than 280m2.ii. The ancillary use relates to an area that is more than one-fifth of the total floor area of the building or compartment.c. In ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4) buildings or compartments, if the ancillary use is storage and both of the following apply.i. The building or compartment has an area of more than 280m2.ii. The storage area comprises more than one-third of the total floor area of the building or compartment.0.22 Where there are multiple main uses that are not ancillary to one another (for example, shops with independent offices above), each use should be assigned to a purpose group in its own right. Where there is doubt as to which purpose group is appropriate, the more onerous guidance should be applied.

For the design of mixed use buildings which include dwellings, Approved Document B Volume 1 should be consulted in addition to the guidance contained in this approved document.  0.24 Where a complex mix of uses exists, the effect that one use may have on another in terms of risk should be considered. It could be necessary to use guidance from both volumes, apply other guidance (such as from HTM 05-02 or Building Bulletin 100), and/or apply special measures to reduce the risk.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB18 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010Requirement B1: Means of warning and escapeThese sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.RequirementRequirementLimits on applicationMeans of warning and escapeB1. The building shall be designed and constructed so that there are appropriate provisions for the early warning of fire, and appropriate means of escape in case of fire from the building to a place of safety outside the building capable of being safely and effectively used at all material times.Requirement B1 does not apply to any prison provided under section 33 of the Prison Act 1952(a) (power to provide prisons, etc.). (a)  1952 c. 52; section 33 was amended by section 100 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (c. 33) and by S.I. 1963/597.IntentionIn the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B1 is met by achieving all of the following.a. There are sufficient means for giving early warning of fire to people in the building.b. All people can escape to a place of safety without external assistance.c. Escape routes are suitably located, sufficient in number and of adequate capacity.d. Where necessary, escape routes are sufficiently protected from the effects of fire and smoke.e. Escape routes are adequately lit and exits are suitably signed.f. There are appropriate provisions to limit the ingress of smoke to the escape routes, or to restrict the spread of fire and remove smoke.The extent to which any of these measures are necessary is dependent on the use of the building, its size and its height.Building work and material changes of use subject to requirement B1 include both new and existing buildings. ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB1Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 9Section 1: Fire detection and alarm systemsGeneral provisions1.1 All buildings should have arrangements for detecting fire and raising the alarm. In most buildings, fires are detected by people, either by sight or smell, and therefore often nothing more is needed. 1.2 In some small buildings/premises, the means of raising the alarm may be simple (for example, a shouted warning). In assessing appropriate solutions, warnings need to be heard and understood throughout the premises.Fire detection and alarm systems1.3 Other than for some small buildings/premises, an electrically operated fire alarm system should be provided. In some situations, the alarm should be operated by a fire detection system. The detailed specification should be compatible with the fire strategy for the building.NOTE: The term ‘fire alarm system’ describes the combination of components for giving an audible and/or other perceptible warning of fire.NOTE: In this document, the term ‘fire detection system’ describes any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and indicating equipment. Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous combustion products or radiation. Automatic sprinkler systems can also be used to operate a fire alarm system.1.4 In ‘residential (institutional)’ and ‘residential (other)’ occupancies (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)), automatic fire detection and alarms should be provided.1.5 Automatic fire detection and alarm systems should be provided in non-residential occupancies where a fire could break out in an unoccupied part of the premises (e.g. a storage area or a part of the building that is not visited on a regular basis) and prejudice the means of escape from occupied part(s) of the premises.1.6 Automatic fire detection will also be necessary where fire protection systems, such as pressure differential systems or door releases, need to operate automatically. 1.7 Every building design should be assessed individually. General guidance on the category of fire detection system that may need to be provided within a building can be found in Table A1 of BS 5839-1. 1.8 Where an electrically operated fire detection and alarm system is provided, it should comply  with BS 5839-1.1.9 BS 5839-1 specifies three categories of system.a. Category L – for the protection of life.b. Category M – manual fire detection and alarm systems.c. Category P – for property protection. ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION10 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1Category L systems are divided into the following.L1 – systems installed throughout the protected building.L2 – systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building (a category L2 system will normally include the coverage required of a category L3 system).L3 – systems designed to warn of fire at an early enough stage to enable all occupants, other than possibly those in the room where the fire started, to escape safely before the escape routes become impassable because of fire, smoke or toxic gases.L4 – systems installed within those parts of the escape routes that comprise circulation areas and circulation spaces, such as corridors and stairs.L5 – systems in which the protected area(s) and/or the location of detectors are designed to satisfy a specific fire safety objective (other than that of a category L1, L2, L3 or L4 system).Type P systems are divided into the following.P1 – systems installed throughout the protected building.P2 – systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building.1.10 Electrical alarm system call points should comply with either of the following.a. BS 5839-2. b. BS EN 54-11 Type A (direct operation). Call points should be installed in accordance with BS 5839-1. Type B (indirect operation) call points of BS EN 54-11 should only be used with the approval of the building control body.1.11 A voice alarm system complying with BS 5839-8, and giving a fire warning different from other signals in general use, may be considered if either of the following applies.a. People might not respond quickly to a fire warning.b. People are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements.1.12 In premises where lots of members of the public are present, an initial general alarm may be undesirable. Any fire alarm system that first alerts staff should comply with BS 5839-1.1.13 Where the escape strategy is based on simultaneous evacuation, actuation of the fire alarm system should give warning from all fire alarm sounders. Where phased evacuation is planned, a staged alarm system is appropriate. See paragraph 3.21.1.14 BS 9999 provides guidance for fire detection and alarm systems in buildings containing atria. Warnings for people with impaired hearing1.15 Clause 18 of BS 5839-1 gives detailed guidance on the design and selection of fire alarm warnings for people with impaired hearing. In buildings or part of a building where people may be in relative isolation, a visual and audible fire alarm may be the most appropriate solution. In buildings where the population is managed, a vibrating personal paging system may be more appropriate.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 11B1Design and installation of systems1.16 Fire detection and alarm systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained. A design, installation and commissioning certificate should be provided for fire detection and alarm systems. Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety.Interface between fire detection and alarm systems and other systems1.17 Fire detection and alarm systems sometimes trigger other systems. The interface between systems must be reliable. Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system. Where any part of BS 7273 applies to the triggering of other systems, the recommendations of that part of BS 7273 should be followed.Student accommodation 1.18 In student residences that are designed and occupied as a block of flats, separate automatic detection should be provided in each self-contained flat where all of the following apply. a. A group of up to six students shares the flat. b. Each flat has its own entrance door. c. The compartmentation principles for flats in Section 7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 have been followed. Where a total evacuation strategy is adopted, the alarm system should follow the guidance elsewhere in this section.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB112 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1Section 2: Design for horizontal escape Introduction2.1 Means of escape should be provided from any point on a storey to the storey exit, for all types of building. The general principle is that any person confronted by a fire within a building can turn away from it and escape safely.2.2 For small shop, office, industrial, storage and other similar premises, the guidance on small premises (see section 4) may be followed instead of the provisions in this section, if they meet both of the following conditions.a. No storey has an area more than 280m2.b. There is a maximum of two storeys plus a basement storey.Escape route designNumber of escape routes and exits2.3 The number of escape routes and exits that should be provided depends on both of the following.a. The number of occupants in the room, tier or storey.b. The limits on travel distance to the nearest exit given in Table 2.1 (which apply only to the nearest exit; other exits may be further away).2.4 In multi-storey buildings, if more than one stair is needed for vertical escape, every part of each storey should have access to more than one stair. An area may be in a dead end provided the alternative stair is accessible.2.5 In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts  of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1,  2 and 5).ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 13B1B1Single escape routes and exits2.6 A single escape route is acceptable for either of the following.a. Parts of a floor from which a storey exit can be reached within the limit for travel distance in one direction shown in Table 2.1 (see also paragraph 2.8), provided the following apply.i. For places of assembly and bars, no one room in this situation has more than 60 people.ii. For ‘residential (institutional)’ buildings (purpose group 2(a)), no one room in this situation has more than 30 people. Occupant number calculations are described in Appendix D.b. A storey with no more than 60 people, where the limits on travel distance in one direction only are satisfied (see Table 2.1).2.7 In many cases, the beginning of a route will not have an alternative escape route (for example, a single exit from a room into a corridor where escape is possible in two directions). This is acceptable if both of the following apply. a. The travel distance to the nearest storey exit is within the limits for routes where escape is possible in more than one direction (Table 2.1).b. The travel distance for the ‘one direction only’ section of the route does not exceed the limit for travel distance where there is no alternative escape route (Table 2.1).Diagram 2.1 shows how to measure travel distances from a dead end in an open storey layout.See para 2.745° min.ABCDTravel distance in a dead-end conditionshould meet all of the following.a.

If the internal layout of partitions, fittings, etc. is not known, direct distances, rather than travel distances, should be assessed. The direct distance should be assumed to be two-thirds of the actual travel distance.2.  Maximum part of travel distance within the room. This limit applies within the bedroom and any associated dressing room, bathroom or sitting room, etc. The distance is measured to the door to the protected corridor that serves the room or suite. Sub-item (b) applies from that point along the bedroom corridor to a storey exit.3.  In industrial and storage buildings, the appropriate travel distance depends on the level of fire hazard associated with the processes and materials being used.  Higher hazard includes manufacturing, processing or storage of significant amounts of hazardous goods or materials, including any of the following. • Any compressed, liquefied or dissolved gas.• Any substance that becomes dangerous by interaction with either air or water.• Any liquid substance with a flash point below 65°C, including whisky or other alcoholic liquor.• Any corrosive substance.• Any oxidising agent.• Any substance liable to spontaneous combustion.• Any substance that changes or decomposes readily, giving out heat when doing so.• Any solid substance with a flash point less than 120°C.• Any substance that is likely to spread fire by flowing from one part of a building to another.4. Places of special fire hazard are listed in the definitions in Appendix A.5.  Maximum part of travel distance within the room/area. Travel distance outside the room/area should comply with the limits for the purpose group of the building or part.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 15B1Access control measures2.8 Measures to restrict access to the building (or parts of it) should not adversely affect fire safety provisions. It may be reasonable to close some escape routes outside normal business hours, but measures should remain to safely evacuate people left inside the building (see paragraph 5.6).Number of occupants and exits2.9 The building design should be based on the number of occupants. If the number is not known, use the appropriate floor space factors (Appendix D).Table 2.2 gives the minimum number of escape routes and exits from a room or storey for different numbers of occupants. This number is likely to be increased by the need to observe travel distances and other practical considerations.The width of escape routes and exits is given in paragraph 2.18.Table 2.2 Minimum number of escape routes and exits from a room, tier or storeyMaximum number of peopleMinimum number of escape routes/exits6016002More than 6003Alternative escape routes2.10 Alternative escape routes should satisfy one of the following criteria.a.

It is not a place of special fire hazard.ii. It is in the control of the same occupier.g. One of the following arrangements is made.i. The enclosures (walls or partitions) of the inner room stop a minimum of 500mm below the ceiling.ii. The door or walls of the inner room contain a vision panel (minimum 0.1m2), so people can see if a fire starts in the access room.iii.

However, it would be acceptable to pass through one stair’s protected lobby to reach another stair.Separation of circulation routes from protected stairways2.15 Where they serve protected stairways that are part of primary circulation routes, self-closing fire doors should be fitted with an automatic release mechanism, to avoid them being rendered ineffective by misuse. Otherwise, the stair (and any associated exit passageway) should not form part of the primary circulation route between different parts of the building at the same level.Storeys divided into different uses2.16 If a storey contains areas for consuming food and/or drink, and where that is not the main use of the building, then both of the following apply.a. A minimum of two escape routes should be provided from each area, except from inner rooms that meet the conditions in paragraph 2.11.b. Those escape routes should lead directly to a storey exit without entering a kitchen or similar area of high fire hazard.Storeys divided into different occupancies2.17 Where a storey is divided into areas of occupancy under separate ownership or tenancy, then both of the following apply.a. The means of escape from each occupancy should not pass through any other occupancy.b. If a common corridor or circulation space is on the escape route, one of the following  should apply.i. It should be a protected corridor.ii. A suitable automatic fire detection and alarm system should be installed throughout  the storey.Width of escape routes and exits2.18 The width of escape routes and exits should meet the provisions in Table 2.3, as well as the guidance in Approved Document M.2.19 If the maximum number of people likely to use the escape route and exit is not known, it should be calculated using the occupant number guidance in Appendix D.2.20 Guidance on the spacing of fixed seating for auditoria is given in Annex D of BS 9999.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 19B1Table 2.3 Widths of escape routes and exitsMaximum number of peopleMinimum width (mm)(1)(2)(3)60750(4)1108502201050More than 2205 per person(5)NOTES:1.

May be reduced to 530mm for gangways between fixed storage racking, other than in public areas of ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4) buildings.5. 5mm/person does not apply to an opening serving fewer than 220 people.Calculating exit capacity2.21 Where multiple storey exits are available, fire might prevent one from being used. Remaining exits need to be wide enough for all occupants, so when using Table 2.3, the largest exit should be discounted.Stairs should be at least as wide as any storey exit leading onto them. While some stairs are not subject to discounting (paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15), because the stairs will be available for other floors, the storey exits onto them are.2.22 To calculate how many people two or more available exits (after discounting) can accommodate, add together the maximum numbers of people that each exit width can accommodate. For example, three exits each 850mm wide accommodate 33110 = 330 people.2.23 If a ground floor storey exit and a stair share a final exit (via a ground floor lobby), then the final exit should be wide enough to evacuate people at a maximum flow rate equal to or greater than from the storey exit and stair combined (Diagram 2.6).ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION20 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1See para 2.23Storey exit (N)DWDS          Minimum 2m, where ‘N’ is greater than 60 people          Number of people served by ground ﬂoor storey exit          Width of ﬁnal exit in metres          Stair width in metresDNWSFinal exitSee para 2.23Ground ﬂoorlobbyEscape stairDiagram 2.6 Merging flows at final exitThis can be calculated using the following formula:W = ((N/2.5) + (60S))/80where:W is the width of final exit in metresN is the number of people served by ground floor storey exitS is the stair width in metres.If the number of people (N) entering the lobby from the ground storey is more than 60, then the distance from the foot of the stair or the storey exit to the final exit should be a minimum of 2m (see Diagram 2.6).

Partitions should continue to the soffit of the structural floor above, or to a suspended ceiling.b. Openings into rooms from the corridor should be fitted with doors, which do not need to be  fire doorsets.Open planning will not inhibit the spread of smoke, but occupants can become aware of a fire quickly.Division of corridors2.26 A corridor providing access to alternative escape routes should be divided by fire doorsets fitted with a self-closing device (and associated screens) where both of the following apply.a. It is more than 12m long.b. It connects two or more storey exits.The fire doorsets (including any screens) should be approximately mid-way between the two storey exits. They should safeguard the route from smoke, while considering the layout of the corridor and any adjacent fire risks.2.27 For buildings other than dwellings (purpose groups 2 to 7): if a cavity exists above the enclosures to a corridor as described above (because the enclosures are not carried to full storey height or the underside of the roof covering at the top storey), the potential for smoke to bypass the enclosure should be restricted by one of the following methods.a. Method 1 – Fitting cavity barriers on the line of the enclosure(s) to and across the corridor (Diagram 2.9).b. Method 2 – Dividing the storey using fire resisting construction that passes through the line of the division of the corridor (Diagram 2.9). Any cavity above this division should be fitted with cavity barriers on the line of division of the storey and the corridor.c. Method 3 – Enclosing the cavity on the lower side by a fire resisting ceiling that extends throughout the building, compartment or separated part.Any door that could provide a path for smoke to bypass the division should be fitted with a self-closing device (but need not necessarily be fire resisting).ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 23B1See para 2.27NOTES:For all methods, where the corridor is a protected escape route, cavity barriers may also be required inany ﬂoor cavity beneath the corridor enclosure(see paragraph 9.5).The sub-division should be carried to full storeyheight and includes sub-division of thecorridor.

It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.b. The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.c. The part of the roof forming the escape route and its supporting structure, together with any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be fire resisting (minimum REI 30).d. The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect from falling.Residential care homesGeneral provisions2.33 The choice of fire safety strategy depends on the way a building is designed, furnished, staffed and managed, and on the level of dependency of the residents.2.34 In care homes for the elderly, some or all residents are likely to need help to evacuate. Buildings should generally be designed for progressive horizontal evacuation (PHE) in accordance with paragraphs 2.35 to 2.46.For other care home types, the most appropriate of either a PHE or simultaneous evacuation strategy should be identified. The approach adopted in the design of a building must be recorded and communicated to the building management team, who can adopt procedures compatible with the building design.Planning for progressive horizontal evacuation2.35 The guidance below on PHE is for care homes where the provisions of the Firecode documents do not apply (see paragraph 0.10).PHE requires areas used for the care of residents to be divided into protected areas by compartment walls and compartment floors. Protected areas provide a place of relative safety, from which further evacuation can be made if necessary.2.36 Each storey used for the care of residents should be divided by compartment walls into at least three protected areas. All floors should be compartment floors.2.37 Every protected area should have a minimum of two exits to adjoining protected areas. Maximum travel distances within a protected area should be both of the following.a. To the exit to the adjoining protected area: as shown in Table 2.1.b. From any point to a storey exit or a final exit: 64m.2.38 A fire in one protected area should not prevent occupants of other areas from reaching a final  exit (Diagram 2.11).

The following guidance also includes measures for people who are unable to use stairs without help.In larger buildings, some escape stairs may need to serve as firefighting stairs, and Section 17 will also apply.Number of escape stairsMixed use buildings3.2 If a building contains storeys, or parts of storeys, in different purpose groups, it is necessary to consider providing either of the following.a. Separate escape routes from the areas of different use.b. Other effective means to protect common escape routes.Single escape stairs3.3 A single escape stair may serve a building (or part of a building) in the following situations.a. When independent escape routes from areas in different purpose groups are not necessary  (see paragraph 3.2).b. From a basement that is allowed to have a single escape route in accordance with paragraph 2.6b and Table 2.1.c. In small premises, provided it meets the conditions in paragraph 4.2.d.

Refuges should meet the following conditions.a. Refuges should be provided on every storey (except ones consisting only of plant rooms) of each protected stairway providing an exit from that storey.b. Refuges do not need to be located within the stair enclosure, but should enable direct access to the stair.c. The number of refuge spaces does not need to equal the number of wheelchair users who may be in the building. A single refuge may be occupied by more than one person during the evacuation procedure.3.5 The following are both examples of satisfactory refuges.a. An enclosure such as a compartment (Diagram 3.1), protected lobby, protected corridor or protected stairway (Diagram 3.2).b. An area in the open air, such as a flat roof, balcony, podium or similar place, that meets both of the following.i. It is protected (or remote) from any fire risk.ii. It has its own means of escape.3.6 Refuges should be a minimum of 900mm  1400mm in size and accessible by someone in a wheelchair. Where sited in a protected stairway, protected lobby or protected corridor, they should not reduce the width of the escape route or obstruct the flow of people escaping.3.7 Refuges should be provided with an emergency voice communication (EVC) system complying with BS 5839-9. It should consist of Type B outstations communicating with a master station in the building control room (if one exists) or next to the fire detection and alarm panel. In some buildings, wireless technology may be more appropriate.3.8 Refuges and evacuation lifts should be clearly identified. In protected lobbies and protected stairways there should be a blue mandatory sign worded ‘Refuge – keep clear’ in addition to fire safety signs.3.9 Paragraph 5.32 gives guidance on using lifts, including evacuation lifts, during a fire.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION30 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1See para 3.5NOTE: People occupying Compartment A would not reach an available refuge until they had entered Compartment B.

To comply with the guidance in Approved Document M on minimum widths for areas accessible to disabled people, this may need to be increased to 1000mm.Calculation of minimum stair width3.13 The width depends on the number of stairs provided and the escape strategy (simultaneous or phased evacuation). If the maximum number of people needing to use escape stairs is unknown, calculate it using the floor space factors in Appendix D.Discounting of stairs3.14 Regardless of escape strategy, where two or more stairs are provided, it should be assumed  that one might not be available during a fire. Each stair should be discounted in turn to ensure  the capacity of the remaining stairs is adequate. This applies to buildings with or without a sprinkler system.3.15 Paragraph 3.14 does not apply if either of the following applies.a. Escape stairs are protected by a smoke control system designed in accordance with BS EN 12101-6.b. Escape stairs are approached on each storey (except the top storey) through a protected lobby.Despite these exceptions, at least one storey exit still needs to be discounted (paragraph 2.21). ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION32 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1Paragraph 3.34 identifies cases where stairs need lobby protection.Simultaneous evacuation3.16 The width of escape stairs should take account of the number of people using them while evacuating all storeys at the same time. The following stairs should be designed to allow simultaneous evacuation.a. All stairs serving basements.b. All stairs serving buildings with open spatial planning.c. All stairs serving ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) or ‘assembly and recreation’  (purpose group 5) buildings.Annexes B and C of BS 9999 include designs based on simultaneous evacuation.3.17 The capacity of stairs of widths from 1000mm to 1800mm is given in Table 3.2.Table 3.2 Capacity of stairs for basements and for simultaneous evacuation of the buildingNo. of floors servedMaximum number of people served by a stair of width:1000mm1100mm1200mm1300mm1400mm1500mm1600mm1700mm1800mm115022024026028030032034036021902602853103353603854104353230300330360390420450480510427034037541044548051555058553103804204605005405806206606350420465510555600645690735739046051056061066071076081084305005556106657207758308859470540600660720780840900960105105806457107758409059701035NOTES:1. The capacity of stairs that serve more than 10 storeys may be obtained by using linear extrapolation.2. The capacity of stairs not less than 1100mm wide may also be obtained by using the formulas in paragraph 3.18.3.  Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).4. Stairs wider than 2000mm should have a central handrail (see paragraph 3.11).3.18 As an alternative to Table 3.2, the capacity of stairs 1100mm wide or wider can be found using either of the following formulas:a. P = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(N – 1)b. W = P + 15N – 15 / 150 + 50Nwhere:ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 33B1P is the number of people that can be servedW is the width of the stair, in metresN is the number of storeys served.Separate calculations should be made for stairs serving basement storeys and stairs serving  upper storeys.The population, P, should be divided by the number of available stairs.The formula is useful to determine the width of stairs where people are not distributed evenly – either within a storey or between storeys.In the formula, 200W represents the number of people estimated to have left the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation, and 50 (W – 0.3)(N – 1) represents the number of people estimated to be on the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation.Worked examplesA 14 storey building contains 12 storeys of offices (ground + 11). The top two storeys contain flats that are served by separate stairs. What is the minimum width needed for the stairs that serve the office floors, for simultaneous evacuation? In the 11 above-ground-floor offices, 1200 people use the stairs. (People in the ground floor offices do not use the stairs.) In this example, two stairs are shown to satisfy the travel distance limitations.a. The population is distributed evenlyThe top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34). Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15).P = 1200/2 = 600, N = 11From the formula:600 = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(11 – 1)600 = 200W + (50W – 15)(10)600 = 200W + 500W – 150750 = 700WW = 1070mmTherefore both stairs should be at least 1070mm wide. But this needs to be increased to 1100mm, because the formula applies to stairs 1100mm wide or wider (see paragraph 3.18).This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 110 people in Table 2.3).b. The population is not distributed evenly(e.g. 1000 people occupy floors 1 to 9, and 200 occupy floors 10 and 11).The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34). Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15).ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION34 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1To find the width of:• the stairs serving floors 10 and 11:P = 200/2 = 100, N = 2From the formula:100 = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(2 – 1)100 = 200W + (50W – 15)(1)100 = 200W + 50W – 15115 = 250WW = 460mmTherefore both stairs between the 9th floor landing and the top floor should be at least 460mm wide.

It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 134 people in Table 2.3).Phased evacuation3.19 Phased evacuation cannot be used in every type of building, but can be advantageous for escape stairs in high buildings. It requires supporting facilities, such as fire detection and alarm systems, to be provided and maintained.In a phased evacuation, the first people to be evacuated are those with reduced mobility and those on the storey most immediately affected by the fire. If needed, subsequent evacuation is done two floors at a time, reducing disruption in large buildings. Phased evacuation enables stairs to be narrower than with simultaneous evacuation, and may be used for any building provided it is not identified in paragraph 3.16.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 35B13.20 Phased evacuation in buildings with a storey over 30m in height introduces the potential for escaping people to impede firefighters entering and operating within the building. This can be addressed by consulting with the fire and rescue service about special management procedures.In very tall buildings, typically with a storey over 45m in height, physical measures may need to be incorporated, such as by discounting a stair.3.21 A building (or part of a building) designed for phased evacuation should satisfy all of the following criteria.a. At each storey except a top storey, stairs should be approached through a protected lobby or protected corridor.b. At each storey, the lifts should be approached through a protected lobby (see paragraph 5.37).c. Every floor should be a compartment floor (REI depending on height and use of the building).d. If there is a storey over 30m above ground level, the building should be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.e. The building should be fitted with an appropriate fire warning system conforming to at least the L3 standard given in BS 5839-1.f. An internal speech communication system should provide communication between a control point at fire and rescue service access level and a fire warden on every storey. The recommendations for phased evacuation provided in BS 5839-1 should be followed. Where it is deemed appropriate to install a voice alarm, this should be in accordance with BS 5839-8.3.22 The minimum width of stairs needed for phased evacuation is given in Table 3.3.Table 3.3 Minimum width of stairs designed for phased evacuationMaximum number of people in any storeyStair width (mm)100100012011001301200140130015014001601500170160018017001901800NOTES:1.  This table assumes a phased evacuation of the fire floor first followed by evacuation of not more than two floors at a time.2.  Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).3.  As an alternative to using this table, the minimum width (in mm) may be calculated from:  (P10) – 100  where P = the number of people on the most heavily occupied storey.  However, the minimum width of a stair should be 1000mm.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION36 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1Worked example using Table 3.3What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 15 storey office building (ground + 14 office floors), assuming a total population of 2500 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)? To satisfy the travel distance limitations, three stairs are required.The building is over 45m in height and designed for phased evacuation. It has been decided to discount one stair to take account of fire and rescue service operations as described in paragraph 3.20. Therefore:• Number of people per storey = 2500/14 = 179.Each remaining stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 90 people).Thus each stair should be 1000mm wide (maximum capacity 100 people).This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum width needed for 90 people in Table 2.3).•  At least one of those stairs needs to be a firefighting stair, therefore a minimum width of 1100mm is needed (see note 2 to Table 3.1).Additional worked example using Table 3.3What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 9 storey office building (ground + 8 office floors), assuming a total population of 1920 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)? To satisfy the travel distance limitations, two stairs are required.As both stairs need to be entered at each level through a protected lobby (see paragraph 3.21),  both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15). Therefore:• Number of people per storey = 1920/8 = 240.•  Each stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey  (i.e. 240/2 = 120 people).•  Thus both stairs would require a width of 1100mm (maximum capacity 120 people) according  to Table 3.3, but:•  Each storey exit needs to be able to serve 240 people, because of discounting as described in paragraph 2.21. The minimum exit width needed for 240 people in Table 2.3 is 1200mm. As described in paragraph 3.10a, the stair should be at least as wide as the storey exit serving it.• The required stair width is therefore 1200mm.Design and protection of escape stairsEnclosure of escape stairs3.23 Every internal escape stair should be a protected stairway (within a fire resisting enclosure). If it is also a protected shaft (i.e. it passes from one compartment to another) or firefighting shaft, additional guidance in Sections 8 and 17 applies.There is one exception: an unprotected stair (e.g. an accommodation stair) may form part of an internal route to a storey exit or final exit, provided that the distance of travel and the number of people involved are very limited. For example, small premises (Section 4) and raised storage areas (see paragraphs 7.6 and 7.7).ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 37B1Construction of escape stairs3.24 The flights and landings of escape stairs should be constructed of materials achieving class A2-s3, d2 or better in all of the following situations.a. If the escape stair is the only stair serving the building or part of the building, unless the building has two or three storeys and is an office building. b. If the escape stair is within a basement storey.c. If the escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level.d. If the escape stair is external, except where the stair connects the ground floor or ground level with a floor or flat roof a maximum of 6m above or below ground level.e. If the escape stair is a firefighting stair.Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse may be added to the top horizontal surface, except on firefighting stairs.3.25 Further guidance on firefighting stairs is given in Section 17. Dimensional constraints on the design of stairs are given in Approved Document K.Single steps3.26 Single steps on escape routes should be prominently marked. A single step on the line of a doorway is acceptable, subject to paragraph 5.22.Helical stairs and spiral stairs 3.27 Helical stairs and spiral stairs may form part of an escape route provided they are designed in accordance with BS 5395-2. If they are intended to serve members of the public, stairs should be type E (public) stairs.Fixed ladders 3.28 Fixed ladders should not be provided as a means of escape for members of the public. They should only be provided where a conventional stair is impractical, such as for access to plant rooms which are not normally occupied.External walls adjacent to protected stairways3.29 With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the façade, as shown in Diagram 3.3).3.30 If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION38 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1See para 3.29Configuration AConfiguration BAccommodationAccommodationStairAccommodationStairAccommodationConfigurations of stairs and external wall1800mmmin.1800mmmin.1800mm min.See para 3.29Fire resisting constructionof adjacent building enclosureFire resisting constructionof protected stairwayNon-ﬁre resisting constructionDiagram 3.3    External protection to protected stairwaysExternal escape stairs3.31 Where a storey or part of the building has more than one escape route available, some of the escape routes may be via an external escape stair, provided the following conditions are met.a.

The lobby should have a minimum 0.4m2 of permanent ventilation, or be protected by a mechanical smoke control system.Exits from protected stairways3.36 Every protected stairway should lead to a final exit, either directly or via an exit passageway. Any protected exit corridor or stair should have the same standard of fire resistance and lobby protection as the stair it serves. The exit from a protected stairway should comply with paragraphs 5.20 to 5.24.Separation of adjoining protected stairways3.37 The construction separating two adjacent protected stairways (or exit passageways) leading to different final exits should be imperforate.Use of space within protected stairways3.38 A protected stairway may only include any of the following.a.

Standards of performance are summarised in Tables B3 and B4. Apart from specific situations described in Sections 1 and 2, and requirements B3 and B5, a minimum performance of REI 30 is sufficient to protect means of escape. Fire resistance of doors5.3 Fire resistance test criteria are set out in Appendix C. Standards of performance are summarised in Table C1.Fire resistance of glazed elements5.4 If glazed elements in fire resisting enclosures and doors can only meet the required integrity performance, their use is limited. These limitations depend on whether the enclosure forms part of a protected shaft (see Section 8) and the provisions set out in Appendix B, Table B5. If both integrity and insulation performance can be met, there is no restriction in this document on the use or amount of glass.5.5 Glazed elements should also comply with the following, where necessary.a. If the enclosure forms part of a protected shaft: Section 8.b. Appendix B, Table B5.c. Guidance on the safety of glazing: Approved Document K.Doors on escape routes5.6 Doors should be readily openable to avoid undue delay to people escaping. Doors on escape routes (both within and from the building) should comply with paragraphs 5.7 to 5.15. Guidance on door closing and ‘hold open’ devices for fire doorsets is set out in Appendix C.Door fastenings5.7 In general, doors on escape routes (whether or not the doors are fire doorsets) should be either  of the following.a. Not fitted with a lock, latch or bolt fastenings.b. Fitted only with simple fastenings that are all of the following.i. Easy to operate; it should be apparent how to undo the fastening.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION48 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1ii. Operable from the side approached by people escaping.iii. Operable without a key.iv. Operable without requiring people to manipulate more than one mechanism. Doors may be fitted with hardware to allow them to be locked when rooms are empty. In places such as hotel bedrooms, locks may be fitted that are key operated from the outside and manually opened from the inside.If a secure door is operated by code or combination keypad, swipe or proximity card, biometric data, etc., a security mechanism override should be possible from the side approached by people escaping.5.8 Electrically powered locks should return to the unlocked position in all of the following situations.a. If the fire detection and alarm system operates.b. If there is loss of power or system error.c. If the security mechanism override is activated.Security mechanism overrides for electrically powered locks should be a Type A call point as described in BS 7273-4. The call point should be positioned on the side approached by people escaping. If the door provides escape in either direction, a call point should be installed on both sides of the door.5.9 In places of assembly and shop and commercial buildings (purpose groups 4 and 5), doors on escape routes from rooms with more than 60 people should be either of the following.a. Not fitted with locks, latches or bolts.b. Fitted with panic fastenings in accordance with BS EN 1125.In non-residential buildings (purpose groups 3 to 7), some final exit doors feature security locks that are used only when the building is empty. Such locks may be appropriate, but management procedures must emphasise their safe use.5.10 Guidance on door closing and ‘hold open’ devices for fire doorsets is set out in Appendix C.Direction of opening5.11 The door of any doorway or exit should be hung to open in the direction of escape whenever reasonably practicable. It should always be hung to open in the direction of escape if either of the following conditions applies. a. More than 60 people might be expected to use it during a fire.b.

Lifts are appropriately sited and protected.b. Lifts contain safety features to ensure they remain usable during a fire.Guidance on the design and use of evacuation lifts is given in Annex G to BS 9999.5.33 Where a firefighting lift is provided, it can be used to evacuate disabled people. Management plans should describe how this would be managed, and what will happen when the fire and rescue service arrives.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION52 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B1Fire protection of lift installations5.34 Lift wells should comply with one of the following conditions.a. Be sited within the enclosures of a protected stairway.b. Be enclosed with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) when in a position that might prejudice the means of escape.5.35 A lift well connecting different compartments should form a protected shaft (see Section 8).5.36 Lifts that rise within a large volume such as a mall or atrium and do not have a conventional well, such as wall-climber or feature lifts, may be at risk if they run through a smoke reservoir. Care should be taken to maintain the integrity of the smoke reservoir and protect people in the lift.5.37 In buildings designed for phased evacuation or progressive horizontal evacuation, if the lift well is not within the enclosures of a protected stairway, its entrance should be separated at every storey by a protected lobby (minimum REI 30).5.38 In basements and enclosed car parks, the lift should be within the enclosure of a protected stairway. Otherwise, the lift should be approached only via a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).5.39 If a lift delivers into a protected corridor or protected lobby serving sleeping accommodation and also serves a storey containing a high fire risk (such as a kitchen, communal areas, stores, etc.) then the lift should be separated from the high fire risk area(s) by a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).5.40 A lift shaft serving storeys above ground level should not serve any basement if either of the following applies.a. There is only one escape stair serving storeys above ground level and smoke from a basement fire would adversely affect escape routes in the upper storeys.b. The lift shaft is within the enclosure to an escape stair that terminates at ground level.5.41 Lift machine rooms should be sited over the lift well where possible. Where buildings or part of a building with only one stairway make this arrangement impractical, the lift machine room should be sited outside the protected stairway.Refuse chutes and storage5.42 Refuse storage chambers, refuse chutes and refuse hoppers should be sited and constructed in accordance with BS 5906.5.43 Refuse chutes and rooms for storing refuse should meet both of the following conditions.a.

Special provisions about fire resistance of elements of structure in single storey buildings.d. Concessions in respect of fire resistance of elements of structure in basements where one or more sides of the basement are open at ground level.Exclusions from the provisions for elements of structure7.3 The following are excluded from the definition of ‘element of structure’.a. A structure that supports only a roof, unless either of the following applies.i. The roof performs the function of a floor, such as for parking vehicles, or as a means  of escape.ii. The structure is essential for the stability of an external wall that needs to be fire  resisting (e.g. to achieve compartmentation or for the purposes of preventing fire spread between buildings).b. The lowest floor of the building.c. A platform floor.d. A loading gallery, fly gallery, stage grid, lighting bridge or any gallery provided for similar purposes or for maintenance and repair.e. External walls, such as curtain walls or other forms of cladding, which transmit only self weight and wind loads and do not transmit floor load.NOTE: In some cases, structural members within a roof may be essential for the structural stability system of the building. In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof  and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by paragraph 7.2a above.

An external wall: Sections 12 and 13.e. Enclosing a firefighting shaft: Section 17.7.5 If a floor is also a compartment floor, see Section 8.Raised storage areas7.6 The normal provisions for fire resistance may be too onerous to apply to raised, free-standing floors (sometimes supported by racking) in single storey buildings used for industrial and storage purposes. The introduction of raised storage areas can alter the effective number of storeys in the building (see the definition of ‘storey’ in Appendix A).7.7 A structure that does not have the minimum fire resistance specified in Appendix B, Table B4,  is acceptable if it satisfies all of the following conditions.a. The structure meets both of the following conditions.i. It has only one tier.ii. It is used for storage purposes only.b. The people likely to be on the floor at any one time are both of the following.i. Few in number.ii. Not members of the public.c. The floor is open above and below to the room or space in which it is situated.d. The means of escape from the floor is in accordance with Sections 2 to 5.e. The floor meets both of the following conditions.i. It is not more than 10m in width or length.ii. It is a maximum of half the floor area of the space in which it is situated.The limitations in (e) may be adjusted if any of the following apply.f. If the lower level has an automatic fire detection and alarm system meeting the recommendations of BS 5839-1, then the floor size may be increased to not more than 20m in either width or length.g. If agreed with the building control body and the fire and rescue service, then it may be possible to vary this dimension and area. However, the safety of firefighters and the distance they may need to travel over or under the floor must be considered.h.

Compartmentation is not needed if one of the different purposes is ancillary to the other. See paragraphs 0.23 and 0.24.8.4 Effective compartmentation relies on both of the following.a. Fire resistance should be continuous at the join between elements forming a compartment.b. Any openings between two compartments should not reduce the fire resistance.8.5 The lowest floor in a building does not need to be a compartment floor.Protected shafts8.6 Stairs and service shafts connecting compartments should be protected to restrict the spread of fire between the compartments. These are called protected shafts. Walls or floors surrounding a protected shaft are considered to be compartment walls or compartment floors.Places of special fire hazard8.7 Fire resisting construction enclosing these places should achieve minimum REI 30.

Form a complete barrier to fire between the compartments they separate.b. Have the appropriate fire resistance, as given in Appendix B, Tables B3 and B4.8.16 Timber beams, joists, purlins and rafters may be built into or carried through a masonry or concrete compartment wall if the openings for them are both of the following.a. As small as practicable.b. Fire-stopped. If trussed rafters bridge the wall, failure of the truss due to a fire in one compartment should not cause failure of the truss in another compartment.8.17 Where services could provide a source of ignition, the risk of fire developing and spreading into adjacent compartments should be controlled.Compartment walls between buildings8.18 Adjoining buildings should only be separated by walls, not floors. Compartment walls common to two or more buildings should comply with both of the following.a. Run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane.b. Be continued through any roof space to the underside of the roof.Separated parts of buildings8.19 Compartment walls forming a separated part of a building should run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane. Separated parts can be assessed independently to determine the appropriate standard of fire resistance in each. The two separated parts can have different standards of fire resistance.Other compartment walls8.20 Compartment walls not described in paragraphs 8.18 and 8.19 should run the full height of the storey in which they are situated.8.21 Compartment walls in a top storey beneath a roof should be continued through the roof space.Junction of compartment wall or compartment floor with other walls8.22 At the junction with another compartment wall or an external wall, the fire resistance of the compartmentation should be maintained. Fire-stopping that meets the provisions in paragraphs 10.24 to 10.29 should be provided.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION70 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B38.23 At the junction of a compartment floor and an external wall with no fire resistance, the external wall should be restrained at floor level.

Between the wall and floor, provide a head detail that is capable of maintaining its integrity while deforming.b. Design the wall so it maintains its integrity by resisting the additional vertical load from the floor above.Where compartment walls are located within the middle half of a floor between vertical supports, the deflection may be assumed to be 40mm unless a smaller value can be justified by assessment. Outside this area, the limit can be reduced linearly to zero at the supports. For steel beams that do not have the required fire resistance, reference should be made to SCI Publication P288.Junction of compartment wall with roof8.25 A compartment wall should achieve both of the following.a. Meet the underside of the roof covering or deck, with fire-stopping to maintain the continuity of fire resistance.b. Be continued across any eaves.8.26 To reduce the risk of fire spreading over the roof from one compartment to another, a 1500mm wide zone of the roof, either side of the wall, should have a covering classified as BROOF(t4), on a substrate or deck of a material rated class A2-s3, d2 or better, as set out in Diagram 8.2a. Thermoplastic rooflights that, because of paragraph 14.7, are regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification are not suitable for use in that zone.8.27 Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse used as a substrate to the roof covering and any timber tiling battens, fully bedded in mortar or other suitable material for the width of the wall (Diagram 8.2b), may extend over the compartment wall in buildings that are both of the following.a.

Terminals of exhaust points should be sited away from final exits, cladding or roofing materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse and openings into the building.10.7 Ventilation ducts supplying or extracting air directly to or from a protected stairway should not also serve other areas. A separate ventilation system should be provided for each protected stairway.10.8 A fire and smoke damper should be provided where ductwork enters or leaves each section of the protected escape route it serves. It should be operated by a smoke detector or suitable fire detection system. Fire and smoke dampers should close when smoke is detected.

When smoke is detected, detectors should do one of the following. a. Cause the system to immediately shut down.b. Switch the ventilation system from recirculating mode to extraction to divert smoke outside the building.10.10 Non-domestic kitchens, car parks and plant rooms should have separate and independent extraction systems. Extracted air should not be recirculated.10.11 Under fire conditions, ventilation and air-conditioning systems should be compatible with smoke control systems and need to be considered in their respective design.Ventilation ducts and flues passing through fire‑separating elementsGeneral provisions10.12 If air handling ducts pass through fire-separating elements, the fire performance of the elements should be maintained using one or more of the following four methods. In most ductwork systems, a combination of the four methods is best. a. Method 1 – thermally activated fire dampers. b. Method 2 – fire resisting enclosures. c. Method 3 – protection using fire resisting ductwork. d. Method 4 – automatically activated fire and smoke dampers triggered by smoke detectors. 10.13 Further information on fire resisting ductwork is given in the ASFP Blue Book.Kitchen extract 10.14 Methods 1 and 4 should not be used for extract ductwork serving kitchens. The likely build-up of grease within the duct can adversely affect dampers.Ducts passing through protected escape routes10.15 Method 1 should not be used for extract ductwork passing through the enclosures of protected escape routes (Diagrams 10.2 and 10.3), as large volumes of smoke can pass thermal devices without triggering them.10.16 An ES classified fire and smoke damper which is activated by a suitable fire detection system (method 4) may also be used for protected escape routes.

The fire load is well defined.b. The probability of fire spreading from one storey to another in a well ventilated car park is low. Guidance is therefore given for three ventilation scenarios.Open‑sided car parks Natural ventilation11.2 For the purposes of assessing fire resistance, a building, compartment or separated part containing a car park may be regarded as open-sided when it complies with all of the following.a. There are no basement storeys.b. Each storey is naturally ventilated by permanent openings at each car parking level. The aggregate vent area is a minimum of 1/20 of that level’s floor area, at least half of which is provided equally by two opposite walls (1/80 on each side). The remaining free area can be distributed wherever possible.c. Where one element of structure supports, carries or stabilises another, the fire resistance of the supporting element at least matches the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element.d. In mixed use buildings, the fire resistance of any element that supports, carries or stabilises an element in the other part of the building should at least match the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element.e. All materials used in the construction should be class A1 rated, except for the following.i. Any surface finish applied to a floor or roof of the car park (or within any building, compartment or separated part adjoining the structure enclosing it), if the finish meets requirements B2 and B4.ii.

This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that both of the following are satisfied.a. The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of fire over the outside surface is restricted.b. The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are assembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building.The extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building. Resisting fire spread from one building to anotherThe external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to adjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings. This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.a. The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.b. The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window  openings and other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in  the other building.c. Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof  is restricted.The extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation to adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB494 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010Section 12: Resisting fire spread over external wallsIntroduction12.1 The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety. Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings. The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.Fire resistance12.2 This section provides guidance on resisting fire spread over external walls; however, it does not deal with fire resistance of external walls. An external wall may need fire resistance to meet the provisions of Section 2 (Design for horizontal escape), Section 3 (Design for vertical escape),  Section 7 (Loadbearing elements of structure), Section 13 (Resisting fire spread from one building  to another) or Section 17 (Access to buildings for firefighting personnel).Combustibility of external walls12.3 The external walls of buildings other than those described in regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations should achieve either of the following. a.  Follow the provisions given in paragraphs 12.5 to 12.10, which provide guidance on all of  the following.i. External surfaces.ii. Materials and products.iii. Cavities and cavity barriers. b.  Meet the performance criteria given in BRE report BR 135 for external walls using full-scale test data from BS 8414-1 or BS 8414-2.12.4 In relation to buildings of any height or use, consideration should be given to the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to reduce the risk of fire spread over the wall.External surfaces12.5 The external surfaces (i.e. outermost external material) of external walls should comply with the provisions in Table 12.1.

Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph.Metal composite materials 12.12 Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height. 12.13 Relevant metal composite materials are defined (in regulation 2(6)(c)) as any panel or sheet, having a thickness of no more than 10mm which is composed of a number of layers two or more of which are made of metal, alloy or metal compound and one or more of which is a substantial layer made of a material having a gross calorific value of more than 35MJ/kg when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1716. A substantial layer is defined as a layer which is at least 1mm thick or has a mass per unit area of at least 1kg/m². Regulation 7(2) and requirement B4Materials 12.14 Regulation 7(1)(a) requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used. Regulation 7(2) sets requirements in respect of external walls and specified attachments in relevant buildings.NOTE: Further guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in HM Government’s Manual to the Building Regulations.12.15 Regulation 7(2) applies to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level (as measured in accordance with Diagram D6 in Appendix D) and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes. It requires that all materials which become part of  an external wall or specified attachment achieve class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 in accordance with  BS EN 13501-1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).NOTE: The above includes student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, dormitories in boarding schools, hotels, hostels and boarding houses. See regulation 7(4) for the definition of relevant buildings.NOTE: Transposition to a national class (Table B1) does not apply to the classification in this paragraph. 12.16 External walls and specified attachments are defined in regulation 2(6) and these definitions include any parts of the external wall as well as balconies, solar panels and solar shading.12.17 Regulation 7(3) provides an exemption for certain components found in external walls and specified attachments.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION98 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010B4Material change of use12.18 Regulations 5(k) and 6(3) provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4), the construction of the external walls, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).Solar shading devices 12.19 Regulation 7(2) requires that the curtain and or slats of solar shading devices in a relevant building (as defined in regulation 7(4)) achieve class A1 or A2-s1, d0. The curtain of solar shading devices cannot be classified as a membrane in accordance with regulation 7(3). 12.20 Solar shading devices installed up to 4.5m above ground level are not required to meet the requirements of regulation 7(2). Additional considerations12.21 The provisions of regulation 7 apply in addition to requirement B4. Therefore, for buildings described in regulation 7(4), the potential impact of any products incorporated into or onto the external walls and specified attachments should be carefully considered with regard to their number, size, orientation and position. 12.22 Particular attention is drawn to the following points.a.  Membranes used as part of the external wall construction above ground level should achieve a minimum of class B-s3, d0. Roofing membranes do not need to achieve a minimum of class A2-s1, d0 when used as part of a roof connecting to an external wall. b.  Internal linings should comply with the guidance provided in Section 4. c.  Any part of a roof should achieve the minimum performance as detailed in Section 12.d.  As per regulation 7(3), window frames and glass (including laminated glass) are exempted from regulation 7(2). Window spandrel panels and infill panels must comply with regulation 7(2).e.  Thermal breaks are small elements used as part of the external wall construction to restrict thermal bridging. There is no minimum performance for these materials. However, they should not span two compartments and should be limited in size to the minimum required to restrict the thermal bridging (the principal insulation layer is not to be regarded as a thermal break).f.  Regulation 7(2) only applies to specified attachments. Shop front signs and similar attachments are not covered by the requirements of regulation 7(2), although attention is drawn to paragraph 12.22g.g.  While regulation 7(2) applies to materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment, consideration should be given to other attachments to the wall which could impact on the risk of fire spread over the wall.h.  Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1 is exempted when it meets both of the following conditions. i. It forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony.ii. It is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material.

The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building. A fire may involve  a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments.b. The intensity of fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system.c. Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purposes groups 1, 2 and 5) represent  a greater risk to life.d. A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.i. Has a similar elevation to the one in question.ii. Is at the same distance from the common boundary.e. The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.13.2 Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section.13.3 If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered.Boundaries13.4 The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 13.1). Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.13.5 The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 13.2). It may be one of the following. a. The site boundary. b. The centre line of a space where further development is unlikely, such as a road, railway, canal or river. c. An assumed notional boundary between two buildings on the same site (Diagram 13.3) where either of the following conditions is met. i. One or both of the buildings are in the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose group 1, 2 or 5). ii. The buildings will be operated/managed by different organisations.

Canopies13.13 Where both of the following apply, separation distances may be determined from the wall rather than from the edge of the canopy (Diagram 13.6).a. The canopy is attached to the side of a building.b. The edges of the canopy are a minimum of 2m from the relevant boundary.Canopies that fall within class 6 or class 7 of Schedule 2 to the regulations (Exempt Buildings and Work) are exempt from the Building Regulations.13.14 Space separation may be disregarded if a canopy is all of the following.a.

Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included, only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees. It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of  a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.Portal frames13.16 Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3). However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings. It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints. Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected. The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.NOTE: The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.NOTE: Normally, portal frames of reinforced concrete can support external walls requiring a similar degree of fire resistance without specific provision at the base to resist overturning.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 105B4NOTE: Existing buildings may have been designed to comply with all of the following guidance, which is also acceptable.a. The column members are fixed rigidly to a base of sufficient size and depth to resist overturning.b. There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support.c. There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release. (The roof venting could be, for example, PVC rooflights covering some 10% of the floor area and evenly spaced over the floor area.)Methods for calculating acceptable unprotected area13.17 Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary. More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead. When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.a. 84kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘residential’ (purpose groups 1 or 2), ‘office’ (purpose group 3) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) or if the building is an open-sided multi-storey car park (purpose group 7(b)). b. 168kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4), ‘industrial’ (purpose group 6) or ‘storage and other non-residential’ (purpose group 7(a)).Method 113.18 This method applies to small buildings intended to be used for ‘residential (other)’ purposes.13.19 The building should not exceed three storeys in height (excluding basements) or 24m in length. Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Diagram 13.7.

(1)  The building shall be designed and constructed so as to provide reasonable facilities to assist fire fighters in the protection of life.(2)  Reasonable provision shall be made within the site of the building to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building.IntentionProvisions covering access and facilities for the fire service are to safeguard the health and safety of people in and around the building. Their extent depends on the size and use of the building. Most firefighting is carried out within the building. In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B5 is met by achieving all of the following.a. External access enabling fire appliances to be used near the building.b. Access into and within the building for firefighting personnel to both:i. search for and rescue peopleii. fight fire.c.

This may be reduced by providing smoke outlets, or smoke vents, which allow heat and smoke to escape from the basement levels to the open air. They can also be used by the fire and rescue service to let cooler air into the basements (Diagram 18.1). 18.2 Each basement space should have one or more smoke outlets.Where this is not practicable (for example, the plan area is deep and the amount of external wall is restricted by adjoining buildings), the perimeter basement spaces may be vented, with other spaces vented indirectly by opening connecting doors. This does not apply for places of special fire hazard (see paragraph 18.7). If a basement is compartmented, each compartment should have one or more smoke outlets, rather than indirect venting.A basement storey or compartment containing rooms with doors or windows does not need smoke outlets.18.3 Smoke outlets connecting directly to the open air should be provided from every basement storey, except for any basement storey that has both of the following.a. A maximum floor area of 200m2.b. A floor a maximum of 3m below the adjacent ground level.18.4 Strong rooms do not need to be provided with smoke outlets.Natural smoke outlets18.5 Smoke outlets should be both of the following.a.

In such cases, it will be necessary to demonstrate that a system or product can meet the relevant performance classification. This will be achieved if the system or product complies with one of the following.a. They should be in accordance with a specification or design that has been shown by a specific test to be capable of meeting that performance classification.b. They should have been designed by using relevant design standards in order to meet that performance classification.c. They should have been assessed by applying relevant test evidence, in lieu of carrying out a specific test, as being capable of meeting that performance classification.NOTE: Some products are subject to Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT). For the purposes of this approved document, such products can be considered to have been shown to be capable of meeting a performance specification as per paragraph B1a. B2 Any test evidence used to demonstrate the fire performance classification of a product or system should be carefully checked to ensure that it is applicable to the intended use. Small differences in detail, such as fixing method, joints, dimensions, the introduction of insulation materials and air gaps (ventilated or not), can significantly affect the performance.B3 Assessments should not be regarded as a way to avoid a test where one is necessary. Assessments should only be carried out where sufficient relevant test evidence is available. Relevant test evidence is unlikely to be provided by test standards which have different classification criteria.B4 Where it is proposed to assess the classification of a product or system in lieu of carrying out a specific test (as in paragraph B1c), this should be done in accordance with the relevant standard for extended application for the test in question and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment. For performance classifications where there is no specific standard for extended application, assessment reports should be produced in accordance with the principles of BS EN 15725 and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment. Further information on best practice is provided in the Passive Fire Protection Forum’s Guide to Undertaking Technical Assessments of the Fire Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence.NOTE: Regulation 7(2) limits components used in or on the external walls of certain buildings to materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 (see Section 12). Assessments cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. B5 Tests and assessments should be carried out by organisations with the necessary expertise. For example, organisations listed as ‘notified bodies’ in accordance with the European Construction ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 137BBBProducts Regulation or laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for the relevant test standard can be assumed to have the necessary expertise. NOTE: Standard fire tests do not directly measure fire hazard. They measure or assess the response of a material or system to exposure to one or more aspects of fire conditions. Performance in fire tests is only one of a number of factors that should be taken into account.Reaction to fireB6 Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own decomposition, to a fire under specified conditions. Products, other than floorings, are classified as A1, A2, B, C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in accordance with BS EN 13501-1. Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain class E. Untested products cannot be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-1. Materials covered by the Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT) process can be found by accessing the European Commission’s website https://eur-lex.europa.eu/.B7 The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C, D and E are accompanied by additional classifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating the lowest production, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the lowest production. NOTE:  When a classification includes s3, d2 this means that there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles.B8 To reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, BS EN 13238 defines a number of standard substrates that produce test results representative of different end use applications. The classification for reaction to fire achieved during testing is only valid when the product is used within this field of application, i.e. when the product is fixed to a substrate of that class in its end use. The standard substrate selected for testing should take account of the intended end use applications (field of application) of the product and represent end use substrates that have a density of a minimum of 75% of the standard substrate’s nominal density. B9 Standard substrates include gypsum plasterboard (BS EN 520) with a density of 700+/-100kg/m3, calcium silicate board (BS EN 14306) 870+/-50kg/m3 and fibre-cement board 1800+/-200kg/m3.NOTE: Standard calcium silicate board is not representative of gypsum plasterboard end use (due to the paper layer), but would be representative of most gypsum plasters (with densities of more than 650kg/m3). NOTE: Classifications based on tests using a plasterboard substrate would also be acceptable for products bonded to a gypsum plaster end use substrate.National classifications for reaction to fireB10 This document uses the European classification system for reaction to fire set out in BS EN 13501-1;  however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions. Where this is the case, Table B1 can be used for the purposes of this document.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION138 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010BBTable B1 Reaction to fire classifications: transposition to national class BS EN 13501‑1 classificationTranspositionA1Material that, when tested to BS 476-11, does not either:a. flameb.  cause a rise in temperature on either the thermocouple at the centre of the specimen or in the furnacesA2-s1, d0NoneA2-s3, d2Material that meets either of the following.a.

If a performance for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/particles is specified, then only the European classes can be used. For example, a national class may not be used as an alternative to a classification which includes s1, d0. Thermoplastic materialsB11 Thermoplastic material is any synthetic polymeric material that has a softening point below 200°C if tested to BS EN ISO 306 Method A120. Products formed from these materials cannot always be classified in the normal way. In those circumstances the following approach can be followed. B12 Thermoplastic materials used for window glazing, rooflights and lighting diffusers within suspended ceilings do not need to meet the criteria within paragraph B19 onwards, if the guidance to requirements B2 and B4 is followed.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 139BBBB13 For the purposes of requirements B2 and B4, thermoplastic materials should be classified as TP(a) rigid, TP(a) flexible or TP(b), as follows:a. TP(a) rigidi. rigid solid uPVC sheetii. solid (as distinct from double- or multi-skinned) polycarbonate sheet a minimum of 3mm thickiii. multi-skinned rigid sheet made from uPVC or polycarbonate that has a class 1 rating when tested to BS 476-7iv. any other rigid thermoplastic product, a specimen of which (at the thickness of the product as put on the market), when tested to BS 2782-0 Method 508A, performs so that both: • the test flame extinguishes before the first mark • the duration of flaming or afterglow does not exceed 5 seconds following removal of the burner.b. TP(a) flexibleFlexible products a maximum of 1mm thick that comply with the Type C requirements of  BS 5867-2 when tested to BS 5438 Test 2 with the flame applied to the surface of the specimens for 5, 15, 20 and 30 seconds respectively, but excluding the cleansing procedure; andc. TP(b)i. rigid solid polycarbonate sheet products a maximum of 3mm thick, or multi-skinned polycarbonate sheet products that do not qualify as TP(a) by testii. other products which, when a specimen of the material between 1.5 and 3mm thick is tested in accordance with BS 2782-0 Method 508A, have a maximum rate of burning of 50mm/minute.NOTE: If it is not possible to cut or machine a 3mm thick specimen from the product, then a 3mm test specimen can be moulded from the same material as that used to manufacture the product.B14 A thermoplastic material alone when used as a lining to a wall or ceiling cannot be assumed to protect a substrate. The surface rating of both thermoplastic material and substrate must therefore meet the required classification. If, however, the thermoplastic material is fully bonded to a non-thermoplastic substrate, then only the surface rating of the composite needs to meet the required classification.RoofsB15 Performance of the resistance of roofs to external fire exposure is measured in terms of penetration through the roof construction and the spread of flame over its surface.B16 Roof constructions are classified within the European system as BROOF(t4), CROOF(t4), DROOF(t4), EROOF(t4) or FROOF(t4) in accordance with BS EN 13501-5. BROOF(t4) indicates the highest performance and FROOF(t4) the lowest.B17 BS EN 13501-5 refers to four separate roof tests. The suffix (t4) used in paragraph B16 indicates that Test 4 is to be used for the purposes of this approved document.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION140 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010BBB18 This document uses the European classification system for roof covering set out in BS EN 13501-5; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions.

Fire resistance is a measure of one or more of the following.a. Resistance to collapse (loadbearing capacity), which applies to loadbearing elements only, denoted R in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.b. Resistance to fire penetration (integrity), denoted E in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.c. Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat (insulation), denoted I in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.B20 The standards of fire resistance necessary for a particular building are based on assumptions about the severity of fires and the consequences should an element fail. Fire severity is estimated in very broad terms from the use of the building (its purpose group), on the assumption that the building contents (which constitute the fire load) are similar for buildings with the same use.B21 Because the use of buildings may change, a precise estimate of fire severity based on the fire load due to a particular use may be misleading. Therefore if a fire engineering approach of this kind is adopted, the likelihood that the fire load may change in the future needs to be considered.B22 Performance in terms of the fire resistance to be achieved by elements of structure, doors and other forms of construction is classified in accordance with one of the following.a. BS EN 13501-2.b. BS EN 13501-3.c. BS EN 13501-4.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 141BBBB23 Fire resistance is measured in minutes.

Table B3 gives the specific requirements for each element of structure.b. Table B4 sets out the minimum periods of fire resistance for elements of structure.c. Table B5 sets out limitations on the use of uninsulated fire resisting glazed elements.B25 This document uses the European classification system for fire resistance set out in BS EN 13501-2 to 4; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions.

Refer to note 1, Table B3 for the specific provisions of test.2. Blocks of flats with a top storey more than 11m above ground level (see Diagram D6) should be fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.NOTE: Sprinklers should be provided within the individual flats, they do not need to be provided in the common areas such as stairs, corridors or landings when these areas are fire sterile. 3. ‘With sprinkler system’ means that the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.4. Very large (with a top storey more than 18m above ground level or with a 10m deep basement) or unusual dwellinghouses are outside the scope of the guidance provided with regard to dwellinghouses. 5. A minimum of 30 minutes in the case of three storey dwellinghouses, increased to 60 minutes minimum for compartment walls separating buildings.6. Buildings within the ‘office’, ‘shop and commercial’, ‘assembly and recreation’, ‘industrial’ and ‘storage and other non-residential’ (except car parks for light vehicles) purpose groups (purpose groups 3 to 7(a)) require sprinklers where there is a top storey more than 30m above ground level. 7. The car park should comply with the relevant provisions in the guidance on requirement B3, Section 11.8. For the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, the following types of steel elements are deemed to have satisfied the minimum period of fire resistance of 15 minutes when tested to the European test method.i. Beams supporting concrete floors, maximum Hp/A=230m-1 operating under full design load.ii. Free-standing columns, maximum Hp/A=180m-1 operating under full design load.iii.

If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance of the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not). In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to vary this principle, for example:i. if the supporting structure is in the open air and is not likely to be affected by the fire in the buildingii. if the supporting structure is in a different compartment, with a fire-separating element (that has the higher standard of fire resistance) between the supporting and the separated structureiii. if a plant room on the roof needs greater fire resistance than the elements of structure that support it.b. If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element should be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions.c. If, due to the slope of the ground, one side of a basement is open at ground level (allowing smoke to vent and providing access for firefighting) for elements of structure in that storey it may be appropriate to adopt the standard of fire resistance that applies to above-ground structures.d. Although most elements of structure in a single storey building may not need fire resistance, fire resistance is needed if one of the following applies to the element.i. It is part of, or supports, an external wall, and there is provision in the guidance on requirement B4 to limit the extent of openings and other unprotected areas in the wall.ii. It is part of, or supports, a compartment wall, including a wall that is common to two or more buildings.iii. It supports a gallery.B27 For the purposes of this paragraph, the ground storey of a building that has one or more basement storeys and no upper storeys may be considered as a single storey building. The fire resistance of the basement storeys should be that specified for basements.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBuilding Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 149BBBTable B5  Limitations on the use of uninsulated glazed elements on escape routes.

Fire resistance in terms of integrity, for a period of minutes, when tested to BS 476-22, e.g. FD 30.  A suffix (S) is added for doorsets where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.b. As determined with reference to Commission Decision 2000/367/EC regarding the classification of the resistance to fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof. All fire doorsets should be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-2, tested to the relevant European method from the following.i. BS EN 1634-1.ii. BS EN 1634-2.iii. BS EN 1634-3.c. As determined with reference to European Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC (which applies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and specified safety components) on the approximation of laws of Member States relating to lifts (‘Lifts Directive’) implementing the Lifts Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/831) and calling upon the harmonised standard BS EN 81-58.C2 The performance requirement is in terms of integrity (E) for a period of minutes. An additional classification of Sa is used for all doors where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.C3 The requirement is for test exposure from each side of the doorset separately. The exception is lift doors, which are tested from the landing side only.C4 Any test evidence used to verify the fire resistance rating of a doorset or shutter should be checked to ensure both of the following.a. It adequately demonstrates compliance.b. It is applicable to the complete installed assembly. Small differences in detail may significantly affect the rating.Until relevant harmonised product standards are published, for the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, products tested in accordance with BS EN 1634-1 (with or without pre-fire test mechanical conditioning) that achieve the minimum performance in Table C1 will be deemed to satisfy the provisions.C5 All fire doorsets, including to flat entrances and between a dwellinghouse and an integral garage, should be fitted with a self-closing device, except for all of the following.a. Fire doorsets to cupboards.b. Fire doorsets to service ducts normally locked shut.c. Fire doorsets within flats and dwellinghouses.C6 If a self-closing device would be considered to interfere with the normal approved use of the building, self-closing fire doors may be held open by one of the following.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION152 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010CCa. A fusible link, but not if the doorset is in an opening provided as a means of escape unless it complies with paragraph C7.b. An automatic release mechanism activated by an automatic fire detection and alarm system.c. A door closer delay device.C7 Two fire doorsets may be fitted in the same opening if each door is capable of closing the opening, so the total fire resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. If the opening is provided as a means of escape, both fire doorsets should be self-closing.If one fire doorset is capable of being easily opened by hand and has a minimum of 30 minutes’ fire resistance, the other fire doorset should comply with both of the following.a. Be fitted with an automatic self-closing device.b. Be held open by a fusible link.C8 Fire doorsets often do not provide any significant insulation. Unless providing both integrity and insulation in accordance with Appendix B, Table B3, a maximum of 25% of the length of a compartment wall should consist of door openings.Where it is practicable to maintain a clear space on both sides of the doorway, the above percentage may be greater.C9 Rolling shutters should be capable of manual opening and closing for firefighting purposes (see Section 17). Rolling shutters across a means of escape should only be released by a heat sensor, such as a fusible link or electric heat detector, in the immediate vicinity of the door. Unless a shutter is also intended to partially descend as part of a boundary to a smoke reservoir, shutters across a means of escape should not be closed by smoke detectors or a fire alarm system.C10 Unless shown to be satisfactory when tested as part of a fire doorset assembly, the essential components of any hinge on which a fire door is hung should be made entirely from materials that have a minimum melting point of 800°C.C11 Except for doorsets listed in paragraph C12, all fire doorsets should be marked with one of the following fire safety signs, complying with BS 5499-5, as appropriate.a. To be kept closed when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep shut’.b. To be kept locked when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep locked shut’.c. Held open by an automatic release mechanism or free swing device – mark ‘Automatic fire door keep clear’.All fire doorsets should be marked on both sides, except fire doorsets to cupboards and service ducts, which should be marked on the outside.C12 The following fire doorsets are not required to comply with paragraph C11.a. Doors to and within flats and dwellinghouses.b. Bedroom doors in ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) premises.c. Lift entrance/landing doors.C13 The performance of some doorsets set out in Table C1 is linked to the minimum periods of fire resistance for elements of structure given in Tables B3 and B4.

They should be designed and installed in accordance with the following.a. For residential buildings, the requirements of BS 9251. b. For non-residential buildings, or residential buildings outside the scope of BS 9251, the requirements of BS EN 12845, including the relevant hazard classification together with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability as described in Annex F of the standard.NOTE: Any sprinkler system installed to satisfy the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations should be provided with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability and is therefore to be regarded as a life safety system. However, there may be some circumstances in which additional measures to improve system reliability and availability specified in Annex F of BS EN 12845 are inappropriate or unnecessary.E4 If the provisions in a building vary from those in this document, sprinkler protection can also sometimes be used as a compensatory feature.BS 9251 makes additional recommendations when sprinklers are proposed as compensatory features.Water supplies and pumpsE5 For non-residential sprinkler systems designed and installed to BS EN 12845, water supplies should consist of either of the following.a. Two single water supplies complying with clause 9.6.1, independent of each other.b. Two stored water supplies meeting all of the following conditions.i. Gravity or suction tanks should satisfy all the requirements of clause 9.6.2(b), other than capacity.ii. Any pump arrangements should comply with clause 10.2.iii. In addition to meeting the requirements for inflow, either of the following should apply.• The capacity of each tank should be at least half the specified minimum water volume of a single full capacity tank, appropriate to the hazard.• One tank should be at least equivalent to half the specified water volume of a single full capacity tank, and the other shall not be less than the minimum volume of a reduced capacity tank (see clause 9.3.4) appropriate to the hazard.The total capacity of the water supply in (iii), including any inflow for a reduced capacity tank, should be at least that of a single full holding capacity tank that complies with Table 9, Table 10 or clause 9.3.2.3, as appropriate to the hazard and pipework design.E6 For the systems described in paragraph E5, both of the following apply if pumps are used to draw water from two tanks.a. Each pump should be able to draw water from either tank.b. Any one pump, or either tank, should be able to be isolated.The sprinkler water supplies should not be used as connections for other services or other fixed firefighting systems.ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION164 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010FFAppendix F: Standards referred toEuropean StandardsNOTE: All the British and European Standards can be purchased at the following address: https://shop.bsigroup.com/.
