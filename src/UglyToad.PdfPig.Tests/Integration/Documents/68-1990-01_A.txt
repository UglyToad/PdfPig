Typical FOXBOX SR HDMI ApplicationFOXBOX SR HDMI • Introduction1  About the FOXBOX SR HDMIThe FOXBOX SR HDMI is an ultra-high performance scaling fiber optic receiver that accepts a proprietary optical signal on a single LC connector from a compatible fiber optic transmitter or daisy-chained receiver located up to 30 km (18 miles) away.The receiver outputs a single link of HDMI video, digital audio (embedded in the HDMI output), analog audio, and RS-232 serial commands. The receiver can scale its video output to one of several resolutions and rates.NOTE: For HDCP compliance:•	A FOXBOX SR HDMI receiver must be paired with a FOXBOX HDMI or PowerCage FOX HDMI transmitter.•	You must connect both fiber optic cables between the transmitter and receiver.•	A signal cannot be daisy-chained and retain HDCP compliance.•	The bidirectional Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is not supported.If the receiver is appropriately configured and has a second fiber optic cable installed, it also can either:•	Receive an RS-232 return from a controlled device and send it to the transmitter via a proprietary optical signal, or•	Output a daisy-chained signal to another receiver.If either RS-232 return or daisy-chained communications are implemented, the receiver outputs a proprietary signal on the second fiber optic cable carrying the signal.For video resolutions up to 1600 x 1200, 1080p, or 1920 x 1200, the video output of the receiver is a perfect, pixel-for-pixel recreation of the video signal input from the transmitter.The single link of HDMI video output by a FOXBOX SR HDMI can be converted to DVI-D video with the appropriate adapter.The receiver has built-in color bars, crosshatch, grayscale, alternating pixels, and crop test patterns, which are available under RS-232 Simple Instruction Set (SIS™) control, to assist in setting up the display equipment and image and audio adjustments. The receiver has image, audio, fiber light status, and lost-light alarm indicators.System CompatibilityThe FOXBOX SR HDMI receiver operates interchangeably with all HDMI, DVI, and VGA transmitters in the Extron FOXBOX, PowerCage FOX, and FOX 500 families, including Plus and non-Plus units.NOTES: • Although the receiver can operate with non-HDMI transmitters, the video output is not HDCP-compliant. • The receiver is not compatible with the FOX AV, PowerCage FOX AV, FOX 3G HD-SDI, PowerCage FOX 3G HD-SDI, and FOX 3G DVC transmitters.  FOXBOX SR HDMI • Introduction2Cable Transmission ModesThe receiver is further categorized by the type of fiber optic cable, multimode or singlemode, which defines the effective range of transmission:•	Multimode (MM) — Long distance, up to 2 km (6,560 feet) (depending on the fiber cable)•	Singlemode (SM) — Very long distance, up to 30 km (18.75 miles)NOTE: The multimode and singlemode units are physically and functionally identical, with the exception of the effective range of transmission. In this manual, any reference applies to either transmission mode unless otherwise specified.FeaturesUltra high performance — The FOXBOX SR HDMI receives pixel-for-pixel HDMI or DVI-D (with an adapter) video transmission, up to 1920 x 1200 at 60 Hz.Video output — The receiver outputs a single link of HDMI video.Compatible with the FOX Matrix Switchers, and FOX 500, FOXBOX, and PowerCage FOX transmitters and receivers (with the exception of the FOX DA6, FOX 2G, and FOX 3G HDSDI products)Analog audio output — The receiver outputs balanced or unbalanced stereo audio on a 5-pole captive screw connector and digital audio embedded in the HDMI output.Links monitoring — The receiver panel has indicators for monitoring image and audio transmission and the fiber optic link.Loss-of-light alarms — The receivers panel has discrete outputs that indicate if either of the fiber optic links has suffered a loss of the light signal.Signal Processing Product Control Program — For RS-232 remote control from a PC, the Extron Signal Processing Product Control Program, which runs under Microsoft® Windows®, provides a graphical interface with drag-and-drop, point-and-click operation.Simple Instruction Set — The receiver uses SIS commandsfor easy remote control operation.Analog audio level — The analog audio output is at the consumer level (-10 dBV).Auto Image™ — The auto imaging feature automatically sizes and centers the input to fill the screen.Upgradable firmware — The firmware that controls the operation of the receiver can be upgraded in the field via an RS-232 link without taking the unit out of service. Firmware upgrades are available for download on the Extron website, www.extron.com, and they can be installed using the Signal Processing Product Control Program.Memory presets — 30 memory presets are a time-saving feature that lets you store input size and position settings relative to a specific input resolution. You can then recall those settings, when needed, using the SIS or the control software.LockIt™ HDMI Cable Lacing Bracket — The receiver includes a LockIt bracket to secure the HDMI cable to the unit.Rack mounting — The receiver is rack mountable in any conventional 19-inch wide rack, using an Extron 9.5-inch or 6-inch deep rack shelf.Power — The 100 VAC to 240 VAC, 50-60 Hz external power supply provides worldwide power compatibility.

Two Way ConfigurationTransmitterReceiver1b1aTxRxTxRx  FOXBOX SR HDMI • Installation4NOTES:	•	Ensure	that	you	use	the	proper	fiber	cable	for	your	transmitter/receiver	pair. Typically, singlemode fiber has a yellow jacket and multimode cable has an orange or aqua jacket. • Only one fiber optic cable, transmitter-Tx-to-receiver-Rx, is required for video, audio, and serial command transmission. However, if you connect only one fiber optic cable, or if your receiver is configured to daisy-chain the optical signal:•	The HDMI signal output by the receiver is not HDCP-compliant.•	You will not receive RS-232 reports from the controlled device.To receive responses from the controlled device and for HDCP compliance, you need to install both fiber optic cables and leave link 2 enabled (via an SIS command to the receiver or using the Signal Processing Product Control Program).Ä Rx — For all one-way video, audio, and serial communications from the transmitter to the receiver, connect a fiber optic cable to the Rx LC connector.Connect the free end of this fiber optic cable to the Tx connector on a FOXBOX Tx transmitter or to any other compatible Extron FOXBOX device.Å Tx (optional) — Connect a fiber optic cable to the Tx LC connector for either of the following functions:Normal configuration — For all one-way return serial communications from the receiver to the Rx connector on a compatible transmitter (see figure 3).Daisy chain configuration — For daisy-chained video, audio, and serial communications to the Rx connector on another receiver (see figure 4).NOTE: The Tx connector emits light in either case and the Rx port receives light.Connect the free end of this fiber optic cable to either of the following:•	The Rx connector on a compatible transmitter or to any other compatible Extron FOX device•	The Rx connector on another receiver in the daisy chainTx Link and Rx Link LEDs — When lit, the link is active (light is received).b HDMI Output connector — Connect a video display to this HDMI connector (see “HDMI connector“ on page 7 for pin assignments).c HDMI Audio switch — This switch mutes (Off position) and unmutes (On position) the embedded audio output on the HDMI output connector. The audio on the captive screw output always remains active regardless of the setting of this switch.d Audio output connector — Connect audio devices, such as an audio LRAUDIO amplifier or powered speakers to this 5-pole, 3.5 mm captive screw connector to output the transmitted, unamplified, line level audio (see “Audio output connector“ on page 9 to wire a captive screw connector for the appropriate output type and impedance level).  FOXBOX SR HDMI • Installation5e RS-232 Over Fiber port — If you want the FOXBOX to pass serial  ALARMTx Rx1    2RS-232OVER FIBERcommand signals to a slave device, for serial control of a projector for example, connect the slave device to the receiver via the first three leftmost poles (Tx, Rx, and _) of this 5-pole captive screw connector (see “RS-232 connections“ on page 8 to wire this connector).NOTES: • If you connect only one fiber optic cable (item Ä, on the previous page), or you configure the receiver for daisy-chaining, you will not receive reports from the controlled device. To receive responses from the controlled device, you must install two fiber optic cables and leave link 2 enabled (via an SIS command [see page 25] or using the Signal Processing Product Control Program [see page 31]). • The FOXBOX can pass RS-232 commands and responses at rates up to 115200 baud.f Alarm outputs port — For remote monitoring of the status of fiber optic ALARMTx Rx1    2RS-232OVER FIBERlink 1, connect a locally-constructed or furnished monitoring device to the receiver via the two rightmost poles (1 and 2) of this 5-pole captive screw connector.  When the receiver does not detect a light link on fiber cable Rx, pin 1 and pin 2 of this port are shorted together (see “Alarm outputs connection“ on page 8 to wire this connector).g Remote RS-232 port — For serial control of the receiver, connect a host device, such as a computer, touch panel control, or RS-232 capable PDA, to the transmitter via this 3-pole captive screw connector (see “RS-232 connections“ on page 8 to wire this connector (see “Remote Control“ on page 20 for SIS commands and software control).h DC power connector — Plug the included external 12 VDC power supply into this connector (see “Power supply wiring“ on page 10, to wire the connector).

FOXBOX SR HDMI • Operation19Remote ControlThis section describes the remote control operation of the FOXBOX SR HDMI, including:•	Simple Instruction Set Control•	Signal Processing Product Control ProgramThe receiver has two serial ports: the front panel Configuration port, a 2.5 mm mini stereo jack (see “Front panel Configuration Port“ on page 11); and a rear panel Remote RS-232 port, a 3-pole captive screw connector (see “RS-232 connections“ on page 8). Either of these ports can be connected to a host device such as a computer running the HyperTerminal or DataViewer utility, or a control system to make serial control of the receiver possible.The protocol for all ports is as follows:•	9600 baud • no parity • 8 data bits•	1 stop bit • no flow controlSimple Instruction Set ControlHost-to-Unit InstructionsSIS commands consist of one or more characters per field. No special characters are required to begin or end a command character sequence. When a command is valid, the unit executes the command and sends a response to the host device. All responses from the unit to the host end with a carriage return and a line feed (CR/LF = ]), which signals the end of the response character string. A string is one or more characters.

Elevated operating ambient — If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be greater than room ambient. Therefore, consider installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the maximum ambient temperature specified by Extron (Tma = +122 °F [+50 °C]). 2. Reduced air flow — Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised.3. Mechanical loading — Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such that a hazardous condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.4. Circuit overloading — Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit and the effect that overloading of the circuits might have on overcurrent protection and supply wiring. Appropriate consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when addressing this concern.5. Reliable earthing (grounding) — Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained. Particular attention should be given to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (such as the use of power strips).FOXBOX SR HDMI • Reference Information38  Extron Headquarters+1.800.633.9876 (Inside USA/Canada Only)Extron USA - West Extron USA - East +1.714.491.1500 +1.919.850.1000 +1.714.491.1517 FAX +1.919.850.1001 FAXExtron Europe+800.3987.6673 (Inside Europe Only)+31.33.453.4040 +31.33.453.4050 FAXExtron Asia+800.7339.8766  (Inside Asia Only)+65.6383.4400+65.6383.4664 FAXExtron Japan+81.3.3511.7655+81.3.3511.7656 FAXExtron China+4000.398766  Inside China Only+86.21.3760.1568 +86.21.3760.1566 FAXExtron Middle East+971.4.2991800+971.4.2991880 FAXExtron Korea+82.2.3444.1571+82.2.3444.1575 FAXExtron India1800.3070.3777 Inside India Only+91.80.3055.3777 +91.80.3055.3737 FAX© 2012 Extron Electronics   All rights reserved.   www.extron.comContact InformationExtron WarrantyExtron Electronics warrants this product against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of three years from the date of purchase.
